  "summary": "The diff implements most requirements but has critical gaps. REQ-1 (Arweave removal) is incomplete: KeyfilePicker.tsx and arweaveClient.ts are still present (not deleted). REQ-6 (thumbnails in MyUploadsPage) is partially implemented with icons but not actual thumbnails. All other requirements (REQ-2 through REQ-5) appear to be fully implemented based on the available evidence.",
