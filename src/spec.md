# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Expand file upload functionality to accept any file type, not just images and videos.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove file type restrictions on the upload page to allow all file types
- Update UI text and messaging to reflect that any file type can be uploaded
- Ensure share page displays non-media files appropriately with filename, size, and download button
- Maintain 2MB file size limit for all file types

**User-visible outcome:** Users can upload and share any file type (PDFs, documents, ZIP files, etc.) through the application, with the same 2MB size limit and sharing functionality that previously worked only for images and videos.
