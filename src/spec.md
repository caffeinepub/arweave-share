# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the static logo in the hero section with an animated video.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the static LookyLoo-logo.png image in the hero section with the LookyLoo-gif.mp4 video file
- Convert the img element to a video element while maintaining the same positioning and styling
- Configure the video to auto-play and loop continuously

**User-visible outcome:** The hero section displays an animated orange camera icon video instead of a static logo image.
