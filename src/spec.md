# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rebrand the application from Arweave to LookyLoo and update login page messaging to reflect the new branding and purpose.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace all instances of "Arweave" with "LookyLoo" throughout the application (page titles, headers, component text, HTML metadata)
- Update login page center card title to "LookyLoo - Frictionless File Share by GeekDice"
- Update login page center card description to explain the frictionless sharing model and owner authentication requirement
- Change sign-in button text to "Sign in or create IID2"

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see the LookyLoo brand throughout the application with clear messaging on the login page explaining that recipients don't need accounts to access shared files, while owners authenticate via Internet Identity.
